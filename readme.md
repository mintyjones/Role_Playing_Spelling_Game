# SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

## A HIGH LEVEL EXPLANATION

As a long term gamer (without much time to play games anymore), I have dabbled in many genre of game. One of the hardest to make an enjoyable experience out of, I feel, is the “educational” game. Out of that genre, there has been one type of game that has always interested me, and that is the humble “spelling” game.

I have decided to make one of these, and design it in such a way that it gives a little flavour to what can be quite a dry subject. I have taken some of the mechanics of “Role Playing Games” and melded that with spelling as the core feature of the game.

## SOLVING WHAT PROBLEM?

I think that, with the introduction of technology into our world, there has been a decrease in the importance of out language and the proper use of it. Cursive writing is becoming a thing of the past, as is the reading of actual paper books. Spelling especially is falling by the wayside and people’s vocabulary is decreasing. THere is a whole world of words out there that are colourful and descriptive.

This game will gives users the opportunity to test their memories and more so their spelling. I have attempted to make it more interesting with the added “role playing” aspect.

## TARGET AUDIENCE

This app is aimed at all genders and all ages. We are never too old to learn and this app offers the choice of difficulty levels so that user can choose their own challenge. Not everyone will be aware of what a “role playing game” is, but we can all appreciate the value of words. 

## HOW WILL THEY USE IT

Players will be asked to create a character - either a wizard, barbarian or thief - and then will have to face the enemy with the task of defeating hordes of ever increasing difficulty.

The enemy “hordes” will take the form of a group of words. The player will be presented with a word on screen for a given amount of time (this is dependent on the difficulty level chosen and which level of the game they are on). They then have a limited time to input the word correctly in order to progress. If inputted incorrectly, they will lose a life (of which they only have a limited number). Once a set number of words have been inputted correctly, they will progress to the next level (or “wave”) of enemies, until they defeat the third and final wave and win the game.

There are “special abilities in the game’, some depending on the character class picked. For example, Barbarians generally have more lives (or “HP”) and have a “Big Strike” ability. All characters (possibly) have a pass ability (essentially allowing them to pass a word. 

Characters amass a score as they play, and the game stores these scores presenting them on a leaderboard.
